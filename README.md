# Random Matrices Study

> Numerical Linear Algebra â€“ **Assignment 4** *(2025)*  
> [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-lightgrey)](#)

A **work-in-progress** repo that will generate, sample and analyse Gaussian random
matrices to showcase high-dimensional phenomenaâ€”norm concentration,
inner-product distributions, and worst-case coherence.  
All theory lives in **[`report.pdf`](./docs/report.pdf)**; this README only covers the *practical* bits.
